Automate jokes, sketches and routines writing process.

5. Functionality: 
     a) Application is restricted only to club residents (performers, writers and management group) with different access writes
     b) Allow users to write jokes, sketches, songs, routines etc and share with the club members<br>
     c) Allow user to create jokes collaboratively in partnership with other club members<br>
     d) Allows the management group to keep track of the writers’ progress by accessing a full statistic on writers by amount of joke setups, joke punch-lines or fully developed material
     e) Increase the productivity of the writing group by 400%

6. Issues:
During the development of the application quality was scarified for the speed and the delivery. Lack of the planning and clear guidance and requirements brought the application to the point where upgrading and extending process is not efficient anymore. Application is usable with minor glitches that do not affect the whole usability.  

7. Future Plans:
     a) Switching to a framework. Currently working on implementing Zend Framework 2 API.
     b) User-friendly interface with mobile device usability
     c) Including Facebook and Twitter add-ons
     d) Including Google Docs for version control for performance scripts
     e) Including Twillio add-ons for messaging of critical updates
